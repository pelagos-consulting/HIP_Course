This course will use mostly the C subset of the C++ language for simplicity, but we use C++ compilers and tools so that we can use a couple of advanced C++ features if necessary. In this lesson we cover just the barest of essential C/C++ syntax. Topics to be covered are:\n",

The total number of bits for a floating point number is then NBE+NBM+1. The Exponent **E** is just an unsigned integer created by a dot product of the Exponent bits with a vector of decreasing positive powers of 2 ranging from $2^{\\mathrm{NBE}-1}$ to $2^0$. The Mantissa is constructed the same way, but the value is $2^{0}==1$ plus the dot product of the Mantissa bits with a vector of decreasing powers of 2 ranging from $2^{-1}$ to $2^{-\\mathrm{NBM}}$. All three components combine together to form the value, as shown below."

Aside from a few lines of example code the main function of this program is to write out a binary file for an image of 32-bit floats of size (NROWS_C=4, NCOLS_C=6). Every pixel contains the dimension 0 coordinate multiplied by the dimension 1 coordinate. The program has a couple of memory errors, one of them is causing the program to crash. Your job is to find these errors using **printf** and the GNU debugger GDB.\n",

    "1. Open a terminal and use **cd** to navigate to the **src/L0_Survival_C++** directory.\n",
    "1. Type **make clean** and then **make** (on Linux) to make the program **image_creator.exe**. Notice that we changed the makefile to compile with flags \"-g -O0\". This enables debugging symbols and turns off all optimisations that might hide code. We could also have compiled the source file directly by typing <br><br>\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "CC -g -O0 image_creator.cpp -o image_creator.exe\n",
    "``` \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. Run the program ```./image_creator.exe``` to verify that it crashes.\n",
    "1. Run the program with GDB using the command\n",

    "```\n",
    "1. Now within gdb type ```run```\n",
    "to start the program. It will execute until it crashes\n",
    "1. We suspect that the program is running off the end of the array. The coordinates **i0** and **i1** should be in the range (0,0)-(3,5). Set a conditional breakpoint using the command ```break image_creator.cpp:66 if ((i0>4)&&(i1>6))```. Then the program will stop if **i0** and **i1** misbehave.\n",
    "1. Use the command ```run``` to execute again until it hits the break point. You can run the command ```n``` to step through the lines of code, and the command ```print``` to print variables.\n",
    "1. Type ```print i0``` to check the contents of **i0**. Does this value make sense?\n",
    "1. Type ```del``` to clear all breakpoints.\n",
    "1. Modify **image_creator.cpp** to use a **std::printf** (or a **std::cout**) statement to print the value of **i0** for each iteration of the outermost loop (line 66). After you change the source you can type ```make``` from within the GDB window to make the program and type ```run``` to run the code again. Why do you think **i0** is exceeding the size of the array allong dimension 0?\n",
    "1. Have a look at how **i0** is being handled. Hopefully the bug will become known at this point. Make the required fix to **image_creator.cpp**.\n",
    "1. You can run the **make** command within GDB to build the program again after changes are made. I have a Makefile that is set up to build the programs. Then perform the **run** command to run the program again. Does the breakpoint still trigger?\n",
    "1. Within **gdb** type ```del``` to remove all breakpoints and then type ```quit``` to quit the program.\n",
    "1. Run program without gdb to see if the program runs successfully."
