    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Setonix is a world class supercomputer, delivering over 27 Petaflops of floating point performance using AMD EPYC CPUs and Instinct MI250x GPUs. As of November 2023 the gpu nodes of Setonix sit in place 25 on the [TOP 500](https://top500.org/system/180123/) list of the world's most powerful computers, and the CPU nodes sit at place 462.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Official documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Pawsey Documentation Portal](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/) should be your first point of call when looking for documentation. That source must take priority if there is any discrepancy between the official documentation and this material. On  this [page](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Setonix+GPU+Partition+Quick+Start) is some specific documentation for using GPU's on Setonix. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Access to Setonix\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, you need a username and password to access Setonix. Your **username** and **password** will be given to you prior to the beginning of this workshop. If you are using your regular Pawsey account then you can reset your password [here](https://support.pawsey.org.au/password-reset/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to Setonix is via Secure SHell (SSH). On Linux, Mac OS, and Windows 10 and higher an SSH client is available from the command line or terminal application. Otherwise you need to use a client program like [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) or [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access with SSH on the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "On the command line use **ssh** to access Setonix.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh -Y <username>@setonix.pawsey.org.au\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Passwordless login with SSH\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid specifying a username and password on each login you can generate a keypair on your computer, like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh-keygen -t rsa\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then copy the public key (the file that ends in \\*.pub) to your account on Setonix and append it to the authorized_keys file in `${HOME}/.ssh`. On your machine run this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "scp -r <filename>.pub <username>@setonix.pawsey.org.au\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then login to Setonix and run this command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir -p ${HOME}/.ssh\n",
    "cat <filename>.pub >> ${HOME}/.ssh/authorized_keys\n",
    "chmod -R 0400 ${HOME}/.ssh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can run \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <username>@setonix.pawsey.org.au\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "without a password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access from Windows with the MobaXterm client\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows 11 and recent builds of Windows 10 have an ssh client that is accessible from the command prompt application. If you can't use `ssh` from the command line then just download **MobaXterm Home (Portable Edition)** from [this location](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html). Extract the Zip file and run the application. You might need to accept a firewall notification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now go to **Settings -> SSH** and uncheck **\"Enable graphical SSH-browser\"** in the SSH-browser settings pane. Also enable **\"SSH keepalive\"** to keep SSH connections active.\n",

The difference between the two is that for [hello_devices_mpi.cpp](hello_devices_mpi.cpp) has the kernel located in a separate file [kernels.hip.cpp](kernels.hip.cpp). Your task is to compile these files into two executables, **hello_devices_mpi.exe** and **hello_devices_mpi_onefile.exe**.\n",

    "Pawsey has extensive documentation available for running jobs, at this [site](https://pawsey.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/US/pages/51928618/Setonix+GPU+Partition+Quick+Start). Here is some information that is specific to making best use of the GPU nodes on Setonix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPU node configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "On the GPU nodes of Setonix there is 1 CPU and 8 Graphics Compute Dies (GCD's). Each of the 8 chiplets in the CPU is intended to have optimal access to one of the 8 available GCD's  (compute devices). To avoid confusion, SLURM regards each of the 8 GCD's in a node as a \"unique GPU\", and we will do the same. Shown below is a hardware diagram of a compute node, where each chiplet is connected optimally to one compute device.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"margin: 1em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:100%;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/Setonix-GPU-Node.png\">\n",
    "    <figcaption style= \"text-align:lower; margin:1em; float:bottom; vertical-align:bottom;\">Overall view of a Setonix GPU node, showing the placement of hardware threads and the closest available compute device.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above diagram we see that best use of the GPU's occur when a chiplet accesses a GPU that is closest to it. It then makes sense to always allocate a chiplet of CPU's to a GPU. Pawsey has simplified resource requests on GPU nodes such that allocations are in packs. Each `allocation pack` is granted the following discrete chunk of resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 chiplet (8 cores)\n",
    "* 1/8 the memory in a node\n",
    "* 1 GPU compute device\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you specify the number of nodes you need with `--nodes`, and the number of GCD's (allocation packs) per node with `--gres=gpu:<number>`. Enough allocation packs must be requested to cover the maximum of chiplets, GPU, and memory in your request, even if these resources are not used. One may optionally add `--exclusive` to use the whole node, though you need to be aware this will make the job more time consuming to progress through the queue and will incur the maximum charge to your service units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the sbatch job you now need to run your parallelised program with `srun`, and pass it the full range of options to exert the control you need for your job, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Option|explanation|\n",
    "|:---|:---|\n",
    "| `--nodes` | Total number of nodes to request. |\n",
    "| `--ntasks=8` | Total number of MPI tasks to request. Should be `<nodes>`*`<allocation_packs_per_node>`/`<gpus_per_task>`. |\n",
    "| `--gres=gpu:8` | Number of Graphics Compute Dies (and allocation packs) requested per node. |\n",
    "| `--cpus-per-task=8` | Number of cores to allocate per task, even if they aren't used. |\n",
    "| `--gpus-per-task=1` | Number of GPU's to make available per task. |\n",
    "| `--gpu-bind=closest` | Attempt to bind each GPU to its closest chiplet. |\n",
    "\n",
    "The evironment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is used to fine-tune the number of OpenMP threads per MPI task. Furthermore the environment variable `MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1` enables GPU-aware communication with MPI. One can try to use `--gpu-bind=closest` with srun to try and make sure each GPU compute device is optimally placed to its closest chiplet, however this might not always work. In such instances see [this Pawsey resource](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Example+Slurm+Batch+Scripts+for+Setonix+on+GPU+Compute+Nodes) for detailed information on how to map CPU cores to GPU's.
