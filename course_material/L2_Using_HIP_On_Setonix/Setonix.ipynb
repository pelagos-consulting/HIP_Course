    "Pawsey has extensive documentation available for running jobs, at this [site](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Running+Jobs+in+Setonix). Here is some information that is specific to making best use of the GPU nodes on Setonix.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the GPU nodes of Setonix there is 1 CPU and 8 compute devices. Each of the 8 chiplets in the CPU is intended to have optimal access to one of the 8 available GPU compute devices. Shown below is a hardware diagram of a compute node, where each chiplet has optimal access to one compute device.\n",
