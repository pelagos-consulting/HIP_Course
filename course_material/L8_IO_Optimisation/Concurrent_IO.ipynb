    "# Optimising compute with concurrent IO in HIP\n",
    "\n",
    "With many iterative processes there is a need to get information **off** the device at regular intervals. Up to this point we have been transferring data off the compute device **after** the kernel is finished. Furthermore, the routines to transport memory between device and host have thus far been used in a blocking manner, meaning the code running on the host *pauses* while the transfer occurs. Most compute devices have the ability to transfer data **while** kernels are running. This means IO transfers can take place during compute, and in some instances may **take place entirely** while the kernel runs. For the cost of additional programming complexity, significant compute savings can be obtained, as the following diagram illustrates:\n",

    "## How to enable concurrent IO\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use multiple streams\n",
    "\n",
    "A stream is a place where one can perform work, such as the execution of a kernel or an IO operation. When no stream or the 0 stream is specified there is a default stream called the **null stream** to which work is submitted. Thus far we have been using just the null stream for compute and IO. GPU's have the ability to run streams that do IO **at the same time** as the stream/s devoted to compute. If a kernel launch does not keep all hardware threads busy on the device, then streams allow for multiple kernels to be run at the same time. In either case **there is a performance avantage to be gained** by using multiple streams. \n",
    "\n",
    "Streams are initialised using the commands **hipStreamCreate** and **hipStreamCreateWithFlags**. The latter command allows one to create streams where the null stream can optionally wait for work in the stream to complete (implicitly synchronise) before running its own work. The command **h_create_streams** from <a href=\"../include/hip_helper.hpp\">hip_helper.hpp</a> is used to create additional streams with the option of passing a flag to implicitly synchronise with the null stream. Below is the code for **h_create_streams**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "/// Create a number of streams\n",
    "hipStream_t* h_create_streams(size_t nstreams, int synchronise) {\n",
    "    // Blocking is a boolean, 0==no, \n",
    "    assert(nstreams>0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    unsigned int flag = hipStreamDefault;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // If blocking is 0 then set NonBlocking flag\n",
    "    // meaning we don't synchronise with the null stream\n",
    "    if (synchronise == 0) {\n",
    "        flag = hipStreamNonBlocking;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Make the streams\n",
    "    hipStream_t* streams = (hipStream_t*)calloc(nstreams, sizeof(hipStream_t));\n",
    "\n",
    "    for (int i=0; i<nstreams; i++) {\n",
    "        H_ERRCHK(hipStreamCreateWithFlags(&streams[i], flag));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return streams;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If streams operate concurrently, then there must be synchronisation controls. HIP events may be inserted into streams, and the event will reach a complete status after all prior work in the stream is done. Both event and stream synchronisation commands can help establish dependencies between streams. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use pinned memory and asynchronous IO calls \n",
    "\n",
    "IO functions such as **hipMemcpy** and **hipMemcpy3D** are blocking, this means they wait until the copy is complete before returning. In HIP these IO functions have a sibling asychronous copy command such as **hipMemcpyAsync** and **hipMemcpy3DAsync** that take a stream as an extra argument and return immediately **only** if the host memory involved in the copy is **pinned**. In managed memory allocations the synchronisation occurs in the background and there is no need for an explicit synchronisation call."

    "### Concurrent (asynchronous) IO solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "In [wave2d_async_streams.cpp](wave2d_async_streams.cpp) and [wave2d_async_events.cpp](wave2d_async_events.cpp) are two solutions for concurrent IO. The goal is to use **multiple streams** so that while one stream is executing a kernel, the others are working on IO.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"margin-bottom 3em; margin-top: 2em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:100%\">\n",
    "    <img style=\"vertical-align:middle\" src=\"../images/concurrent_io.svg\"> <figcaption style= \"text-align:lower; margin:1em; float:bottom; vertical-align:bottom;\">Figure: Concurrent IO solution.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Both solutions use one stream for compute and a number of streams for IO, however the difference between the two solutions is that [wave2d_async_streams.cpp](wave2d_async_streams.cpp) mainly uses synchronisation on streams to establish the necessary dependencies between IO and compute, while [wave2d_async_events.cpp](wave2d_async_events.cpp) mainly uses HIP events to achieve the same synchronisation. Both accomplish the same task of moving data while compute is taking place.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concurrent access to buffers from the host and device\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a **race condition** to read from a device allocation (from another stream) at the same time as a kernel is writing to the allocation. Furthermore, while it is technically possible to asynchronously read from an array that is also being read by a kernel, it can lead to undefined behaviour, as memory can be moved around. Therefore, it is **recommended** to perform IO only on buffers that we **know for sure** are not being used by a kernel. Our kernel needs access to wavefields at timesteps $\\textbf{U}_{0}, \\textbf{U}_{1}, \\textbf{U}_{2}$, therefore they are active and **not safe** to copy, but wavefields at earlier timesteps e.g $\\textbf{U}_{-2}, \\textbf{U}_{-1}$ **are** inactive and safe to copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"margin-bottom 3em; margin-top: 2em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:30%\">\n",
    "    <img style=\"vertical-align:middle\" src=\"../images/wavefields.svg\"> <figcaption style= \"text-align:lower; margin:1em; float:bottom; vertical-align:bottom;\">Figure: Active (not okay to copy) and inactive (okay to copy) wavefields.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, the solution to enable concurrent IO and avoid race conditions is to have an array of at least four memory allocations on the device to represent the wavefield. Then the kernel can operate on the active wavefields, while IO stream/s copy from inactive wavefields. An array of **nscratch=5** allocations to allow extra leeway for copies to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "During construction of these examples I found it **difficult to maintain synchronisation** when using multiple streams for compute, therefore a **stable solution** used one stream for compute to ensure there were no issues. The concurrent IO solutions use an array of five streams for IO and one stream for compute. Also allocated is an array of five events to demonstrate the use of events in workflow dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output array converted to pinned memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In [wave2d_async_streams.cpp](wave2d_async_streams.cpp) and [wave2d_async_events.cpp](wave2d_async_events.cpp) the 3D output array **out_h** on the host is allocated as pinned memory using **hipHostMalloc** to enable asynchronous copies. I encountered **silent failures** when trying to use addresses **within the pinned memory allocation** as inputs to **hipMemcpyAsync**. Therefore I had to use **hipMemcpy3DAsync** to perform the copies asynchronously and pass in the host pointer returned by **hipHostmalloc**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stream-based synchronisation\n",
    "\n",
    "In [wave2d_async_streams.cpp](wave2d_async_streams.cpp) we use explicit stream-based synchronisation. During each iteration **n** of the time loop then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use **hipStreamSynchronize** to make the host wait for all streams associated with past copies, as well as the compute stream.\n",
    "1. Submit the kernel to compute stream to solve for U[(n+2)%nscratch], then record an event (at index **n**) into the compute stream.\n",
    "1. The wavefield at (**n**-1) (which we term the *copy_index*) is only safe to copy once the compute stream (from the previous iteration) is done with it. Use **hipStreamWaitEvent** to make the IO stream at (**n**-1) wait on event at (**n**-1). Then use the IO stream and **hipMemcpy3DAsync** to asynchronously copy the wavefield at (**n**-1) to the stack of output images. \n",
    "\n",

    "In the concurrent examples you might notice the use of **hipMemcpy3DAsync** to copy wavefields as planes back to the 3D host memory allocation **out_h**. This is because using **hipMemcpyAsync** to copy device memory to an address within a pinned memory allocation **failed silently** and produced faulty copies. Therefore it is **not recommended** to perform asychronous copies with pointers derived from *within* a pinned memory allocation. Only use the pointer returned by **hipHostMalloc** with asynchronous copy functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems were also encountered with **hipMemcpy3D** and **hipMemcpy3DAsync**. For some bizarre reason, during construction of these examples I found that on AMD platforms a value of **copy_parms.dstPos.z=1** resulted in an error for calls to either **hipMemcpy3D** or **hipMemcpy3DAsync**. This strange behaviour was not present with the NVIDIA backend. I have worked around this issue by only copying planes when the plane index z is greater than 2. Hopefully this issue is addressed in a future version of ROCM."

With concurrent IO it is a safety measure to avoid accessing memory allocations that are being used by a kernel, unless the allocated is managed. Both stream and event-based synchronisation can establish and enforce dependencies between activity that occurs across multiple streams."
