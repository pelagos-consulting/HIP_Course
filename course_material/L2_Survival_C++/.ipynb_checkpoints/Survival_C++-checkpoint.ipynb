This course will use mostly the C subset of the C++ language for simplicity, but we use C++ compilers and tools so that we can use a couple of advanced C++ features if necessary.

The total number of bits for a floating point number is then NBE+NBM+1. The Exponent **E** is just an unsigned integer created by a dot product of the Exponent bits with a vector of decreasing positive powers of 2 ranging from $2^{\\mathrm{NBE}-1}$ to $2^0$. The Mantissa is constructed the same way, but the value is $2^{0}==1$ plus the dot product of the Mantissa bits with a vector of decreasing powers of 2 ranging from $2^{-1}$ to $2^{-\\mathrm{NBM}}$. All three components combine together to form the value, as shown below."

    "\n",
    "The program [image_creator.cpp](image_creator.cpp) contains most of the concepts in C++ that are taught in this lesson. Aside from a few lines of example code the main function of this program is to write out a binary file for an image of 32-bit floats of size (N0=512, N1=1024). Every pixel contains the dimension 0 coordinate multiplied by the dimension 1 coordinate. The program has a couple of memory errors, one of them is causing the program to crash. Your job is to find these errors using **printf** and the GNU debugger GDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the file using this [link](image_creator.cpp) and have a look to see what the file is doing.\n",
    "1. Open a terminal and use **cd** to navigate to the **src/L2_Survival_C++** directory.\n",
    "1. Type **make clean** and then **make** (on Linux) to make the program **image_creator.exe**. Notice that we changed the makefile to compile with flags \"-g -O0\". This enables debugging symbols and turns off all optimisations that might hide code. We could also have compiled the source file directly by typing <br><br>\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "g++ -g -O0 image_creator.cpp -o image_creator.exe\n",

    "1. Run the program with GDB using the command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gdb ./image_creator.exe\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Now within gdb type ```run```\n",
    "to start the program. It will execute until it reaches the point of the crash.\n",
    "1. Still within GDB and after the crash type ```print i0``` to check the contents of **i0** the value of the outermost loop variable. Does this value make sense?\n",
    "1. Modify **image_creator.cpp** to use a **std::printf** statement to print the value of **i0** for each iteration of the outermost loop (line 50). After you change the source you can type ```make``` from within the GDB window to make the program and type ```run``` to run the code again. Why do you think **i0** is exceeding the size of the array in dimension 0?\n",
    "1. Have a look at how **i0** is being handled. Hopefully the bug will become known at this point. Make the required fix to **image_creator.cpp**.\n",
    "1. You can run the **make** command within GDB to build the program again after changes are made. I have a Makefile that is set up to build the programs. Then perform the **run** command to run the program again.\n",
    "1. Run the sanity check below to see if the image has been created successfully."

When the C function **std::printf** tries to print strings it continues until it hits a string termination character. Insert this character at the end of where **str** is declared and type **make** to recompile.\n",
