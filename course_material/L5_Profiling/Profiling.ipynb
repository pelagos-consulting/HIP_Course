    "# Measuring performance in HIP applications\n",
    "\n",
    "An understanding of how well HIP applications perform is a vital part of the development process. Two main techniques, **profiling** and **tracing** collect information about how well an application is performing. **Profiling** is the statistical collection of the cumulative time that threads spend in each program component. **Tracing** is a collection of both **when** and **for how long** threads spend in each application component. Since HIP applications use either an AMD or a CUDA backend, the profiling tools from each platform are available for use."

    "\n",
    "The **[Arithmetic intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roofline_model#Arithmetic_intensity)** of an algorithm is the ratio of floating point operations (FLOPS) computed per byte transferred. It helps us gauge if an algorithm is likely to be constrained by either the bandwidth or floating point performance of a compute resource. In matrix multiplication the input matrix **A** is of size ($N_{0,C}, N_{1,A}$) and **B** is of size ($N_{1,A}, N_{1,C}$). Every element of matrix **C** requires $N_{1,A}$ loads from A, $N_{1,A}$ loads from B, and 1 store to **C**. It also requires $N_{1,A}$ multiplications and $N_{1,A}$ additions. The arithmetic intensity of matrix multiplication is then\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ a \\approx \\frac{1}{b}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If a processor has a peak floating point performance of $\\textbf{F}_{P}$ FLOP/second, and a particular cache can feed that processor at a peak bandwidth of $\\textbf{B}_{P}$ bytes/second, then we can calculate a floating point limit that is dependent on memory bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{B} = a  \\frac{\\mbox{FLOP}}{\\mbox{byte}} B_{P}\\frac{\\mbox{byte}}{\\mbox{second}} = a B_{P} \\frac{\\mbox{FLOP}}{\\mbox{second}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual attainable floating point performance will be either $F_{B}$ or $F_{P}$, whatever is lower. If we set $F_{B} = F_{P}$ then we can solve for the crossover point in arithmetic intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_{0}=\\frac{F_{P}}{B_{P}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the limits (or roofline) on performance is as follows:  \n",

    "F_{P}& \\mbox{otherwise}\n",

    "\\right .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a single compute device in a AMD Mi250x GPU processor has a peak 32-bit floating point processing rate of $F_{P} = 23.95$ TFLOPS and a peak memory bandwidth of $F_{B}=1.6$ TB/s from global memory.

The crossover point for 32-bit floating point arithmetic and global memory is correctly situated around **a=15**. Performance in loading memory cache appears to be close to optimal at the theoretical arithmetic intensity of a=0.25, however significant gains in performance look possible if we can improve loads from main memory.

External tools such as `rocprof` can trace applications to collect information on **when** and for **how long** compute resources are used, as well as collecting low level information from hardware performance counters. Higher level tools like **Omnitrace** and **Omniperf** collect additional information and make the information obtained through rocprof more accessible through GUI-based reporting tools. Since HIP is a cross-platform environment, we conclude the chapter by walking through some performance monitoring tools that NVIDIA backends can make use of."
