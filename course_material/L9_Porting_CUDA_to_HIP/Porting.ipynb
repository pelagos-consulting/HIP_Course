    "# Porting CUDA programs to HIP\n",
    "\n",
    "HIP API calls are designed to closely match their CUDA equivalents. This enables HIP to function as a thin layer over CUDA and allows for reasonably easy porting of CUDA code to HIP code. Often it is just a matter of replacing **cuda -> hip** in the function calls, but not always. The ROCM suite provides two different tools **hipify-perl** and **hipify-clang** to help with the porting process. The tool **hipify-perl** is robust and uses perl to perform an intelligent (meaning it is aware of the CUDA and HIP API differences) search and replace of cuda calls with hip calls, while the **hipify-clang** tool uses the clang preprocessor and is intended to produce a high quality port. The perl-based method is better for quick ports of small codes, while the clang-based method is intended for ports of large codebases. The hipify-clang tool is more **fragile** though and fails easily unless it has access to all the header files used in the compilation of the CUDA code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported API's\n",
    "\n",
    "The hipify tools will port a majority of CUDA calls as well as calls to CUDA libraries like **cuBLAS**. Tables in [this Github site](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIPIFY/blob/amd-staging/docs/supported_apis.md) provides some guidance as to what is supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation on porting\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation from AMD at this [site](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/develop/user_guide/hip_porting_guide.html) provides in-depth knowledge about the porting process and preprocessor directives. The guide below is intended to provde complementary information to the official documentation."

    "## Setup and installation\n",
    "\n",
    "From [this source](https://sep5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Programming_Guides/HIP-porting-guide.html) it is recommended to attempt porting on a machine that has access to both CUDA and HIP libraries. This usually means doing the port on a machine with an NVIDIA GPU and access to CUDA. Then one can try porting portions of the code at a time and compare results. For best results during porting you need to have a version of CUDA that is compatible with your installed version of hipify-clang. The table at [this resource](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIPIFY/en/latest/hipify-clang.html) provides information on which version of **hipify-clang** is compatible with which version of CUDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the code is ported and compiles with the HIP compiler, it is important to be aware that HIP functions may try to access ROCm libraries on the backend without prior warning of this dependency. It is then a good idea to make sure you have a complete installation of ROCm, in addition to having a version of ROCm that is API compatible with your code's version of CUDA. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to be aware that some HIP libraries like **hipBLAS** are built to use the corresponding library from ROCm by default. If you need to use these libaries with a CUDA backend you might need to recompile those libraries for use with CUDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below shows what version of hipify-clang that you are using."

    "## General porting process\n",
    "\n",
    "The general porting process proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compile with CUDA to verify that the program compiles.\n",
    "1. Run a hipify tool to convert sources.\n",
    "    * Use the flag `-hip-kernel-execution-syntax` to convert CUDA kernel launch syntax to HIP kernel launch syntax.\n",
    "1. Adjust the compilation environment to use **hipcc**.\n",
    "    * This has to be manually ported!\n",
    "1. Fix compilation errors.\n",
    "    * It can be the most difficult part of porting!\n",
    "    * Use environment variable `HIP_PLATFORM=nvidia` or `HIP_PLATFORM=amd` to switch between backends.\n",
    "    * Preprocessor directives can separate CUDA code from hip-clang code.\n",
    "        * Use the directive `__HIP_PLATFORM_NVIDIA__` for CUDA-specific code.\n",
    "        * Use the directive `__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__` for separate AMD-specific code.\n",
    "1. Verify code correctness.\n",
    "    * Test on CUDA and AMD architectures to ensure portability\n",
    "1. Re-tune optimisations for new architecture, but only once you know everything works!\n",
    "1. Document the changes made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The step of running the **hipify** tool is the **easiest part** of the process.  If the code uses simple and well-supported CUDA API calls, then this has the greatest chance of succeeding. If the codebase contains CUDA-specific complexity, or relies on functionality that is no longer supported by recent version of CUDA, then the level of difficulty in porting can increase **dramatically**. Adjusting the compilation environment for **hipcc** often requires knowledge of  build tools, usually this means a working knowledge of **make** or **cmake**.\n",
    "Familiarity with C++ and what the compiler warnings and errors mean is then crucial to massaging the codebase to accept the new compiler.\n"

The tool Omniperf is good at showing the occupancy of your kernels.

    "\n",
    "Maintaining a codebase to work across both AMD and NVIDIA backends is a difficult task, especially if you are trying to ensure the code is both performant and portable between platforms. An easier task might be to use abstraction to separate the science from the hardware access. Then you can construct vendor-specific libraries to access the hardware and do the math transformations, and choose between them at compiler time. For an example of this see [this code](https://github.com/pelahi/profile_util) from Pawsey staff member Pascal Elahi. Alternatively, you can use libraries like [kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos) or [raja](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/raja-managing-application-portability-next-generation-platforms) to manage hardware access at the cost of transparency.
